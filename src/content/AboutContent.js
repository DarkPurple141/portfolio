   `I'm a designer and engineer. I believe good software is maintainable, testable, and shipped. I believe premature optimisation is evil. I don't forget the value of the aesthetic.
    I'm a writer and journalist. I've written for print and online, worked in television and have produced and run multiple podcasts.
    I'm a teacher. I blog regularly, and teach computer science at UNSW. I'm hopeful of injecting a new generation of computer scientists with the passion I have for the subject.
    Got something cool on the boil? I'm interested. Hit me up.`,
