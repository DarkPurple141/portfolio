   `I’m a computer science student, formerly a journalist and producer who has worked across online, print and television media.
   I’ve always been interested in computers and software, but became driven to
   understand them more deeply after seeing the influence of algorithms in the media.
   I’m particularly interested in content algorithms and systems design, but find most computer (and data) science endlessly fascinating.
   I bring a unique set of skills and experience with nearly a decade in journalism; where the ability to quickly synthesise complex information was critical in a team-oriented environment; combined with a solid technical grounding in computer science.`,
