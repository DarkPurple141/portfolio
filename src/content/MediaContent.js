`Al has worked in the media since 2009 across print, television and online. He began as a communications intern at political advocacy group, GetUp! and worked with them through the 2010 Federal Election.
In late 2010 he found a full-time job as a reporter and online editor with British Publisher Future PLC where he worked for sporting titles BikeRadar and Cyclingnews. Al travelled within regional Australia as a reporter for Cyclingnews covering the Subaru National Road Series, and was also given the opportunity to go to Colombia briefly as a correspondent. In 2011, Al left Cyclingnews after being offered a position as a journalist with SBS.
Al has been involved at SBS ever since. Though initially an online and social media monkey, he was quickly identified as strong television performer and was afforded more and more opportunities in the area. In 2014 he was invited to cover the Tour de France on location with SBS where he excelled, all the while diarising his time overseas online in photos and short blogs for the Tour website.
At SBS Al has also found a niche as a columnist and opinion writer, developing a strong following on twitter and through his blog on the SBS Cycling Central website.
In 2013, Al relaunched the SBS Cycling Podcast, and has hosted and produced it in the time since. He's an efficient user of broadcast editing software Quantel, Final Cut X, and audio program Nettia, can code in HTML and javascript and is a keen photographer.
He has worked with SBS personalities David Basheer, Henk Vogels, Dave McKenzie, Kate Bates, Scott McGrory, Michael Tomalaris and Matt Keenan.
He's also appeared on ABC local radio, Triple J, and SBS Radio.`
