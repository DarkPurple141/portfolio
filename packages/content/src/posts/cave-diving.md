I quite like to induldge the YouTube algorithm sometimes and see where it takes
me. Recently, I was served a video of the
[Nutty Putty cave incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutty_Putty_Cave). I
went down a rabbit hole.

I'm not really into caving. I'm claustrophobic, although I have been in a few
tight caves previously it's not something that I've ever really enjoyed. So this
YouTube adventure was more of a morbid curiosity than anything else.

This is the video:

It's a 20 minute or so account of the incident. It's a pretty harrowing story.

That led me to this video on the Veryovkina Cave:

Which led me to (this one actually has a generally postive ending):

Which led me to this now in cave _diving_. Which is a whole other level of
crazy:

## Why do people do this?

I don't really get it. I mean I kinda get the risk and adventure lens to some
extent but really nothing about this feels even remotely sane - which maybe is
why I couldn't help but watch more. It's uncomfortable, it's claustrophobic, and
at the end you're left in pitch dark, freezing cold - and then you turn around.

People die doing this. The Nutty Putty incident just feels so pointless.

I don't know why it's stuck with me, but maybe because I've got young kids and
quite a few of the cavers (always young men) tend to have families too and are
putting themselves in needlessly risky situations. Anyway just thought I'd share
here.
