title: How I made my resumé into a website
slug: resume-into-a-website

  Along time ago I designend and built my resumé in HTML. It was a fun little
  project. I’ve recently transformed the same HTML into a website. This is how I
  did it.

Some people find their websites become glorified resumés. About five years ago I
set out to do the opposite, I made my resumé from HTML and hosted it on one of
my [miscellaneous domains](https://misc.alhinds.com/resume). This was pretty
cool. It gave me a bunch of flexibility and allowed me to leverage the same CSS
theme across other personal branding projects. A nifty little feature is with
the following CSS:

```css
@page {
  size: 210mm 317mm;
  margin: 0;
}
```

... It also prints correctly on A4 paper. So if I ever needed a PDF for a
recruiter I could print the page and voila, I had a PDF (I know, I know, I could
have just made a PDF, but where’s the fun in that?).

Over the years I’ve made a few updates to the resumé, but it’s mostly remained
the same. It was bugging me though that it wasn't really a website. It was a PDF
pretending to be one. It wasn't:

- responsive
- accessible (there were all sorts of contrast violations)
- it didn't have dark mode (okay this is probably not necessary, but I wanted
  it)

So I did a revamp. It's live now at
[static.alhinds.com](https://static.alhinds.com).
