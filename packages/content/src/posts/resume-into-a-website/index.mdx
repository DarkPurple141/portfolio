title: How I made my resumé into a website

  A while back I designed and built my resumé in HTML. I’ve recently transformed
  the same HTML into a proper website.

About five years ago I decided to remake my resumé from HTML and hosted it on
one of my [miscellaneous domains](https://misc.alhinds.com/resume). Designing
and building in HTML and CSS is something I enjoy doing - it's flexible and
familiar so it was a fun little project and delivered a result that I was happy
with. It also gave me a bunch of flexibility to leverage the same CSS across
other personal branding web projects.

A key constraint was ensuring it could be printed on a single page - and I
managed to achieve that with the following CSS:

```css
@page {
  size: 210mm 317mm;
  margin: 0;
}
```

... and with some fine tuning on the size, and volume of content it prints
correctly on A4 paper. If I ever needed a PDF for a recruiter I could print the
page and voila, I had a PDF (I know, I know, I could have just made a PDF, but
where’s the fun in that?).

Over the years I’ve made a few updates to the resumé, but the design and layout
has mostly remained the same. It was bugging me though that it wasn't _really_ a
website. It was a PDF dressed up with some flavour. It wasn't:

- responsive
- accessible (there were all sorts of contrast violations)
- it didn't have dark mode (okay this is probably not necessary, but I wanted
  it)

So I did a revamp. It's live now at
[static.alhinds.com](https://static.alhinds.com).

## Before and after

<div style={{ display: 'grid', gridTemplateColumns: '1fr 1fr', gap: '1rem' }}>
  <img
    src="https://static.alhinds.com/resume-into-a-website/mobile-before.png"
    alt="Screenshot of the old resume in mobile"
  />
  <img
    src="https://static.alhinds.com/resume-into-a-website/mobile.png"
    alt="Screenshot of the new resume in mobile"
  />
</div>

Note this still prints at A4. I didn't change the HTML structure at all. What I
did change were some of the design constraints (via CSS) for the mobile view.
The key now is that all content flows in a column/block layout on all viewports,
with some of the typography and spacing also scaling with the viewport.

Because I've been working heavily in the design system space recently I also
coined a proper theme file for the site which I'm now sharing with this website
too. This means all the typography, color and space requirements are defined in
one place and this helps to keep the two sites in relative harmony.
