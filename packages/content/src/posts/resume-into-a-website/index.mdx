title: How I made my resumé into a website

  Along time ago I designend and built my resumé in HTML. It was a fun little
  project. I’ve recently transformed the same HTML into a website. This is how I
  did it.

Some people find their websites become glorified resumés. About five years ago I
set out to do the opposite, I made my resumé from HTML and hosted it on one of
my [miscellaneous domains](https://misc.alhinds.com/resume). This was pretty
cool. It gave me a bunch of flexibility and allowed me to leverage the same CSS
theme across other personal branding projects. A nifty little feature is with
the following CSS:

```css
@page {
  size: 210mm 317mm;
  margin: 0;
}
```

... It also prints correctly on A4 paper. So if I ever needed a PDF for a
recruiter I could print the page and voila, I had a PDF (I know, I know, I could
have just made a PDF, but where’s the fun in that?).

Over the years I’ve made a few updates to the resumé, but it’s mostly remained
the same. It was bugging me though that it wasn't really a website. It was a PDF
pretending to be one. It wasn't:

- responsive
- accessible (there were all sorts of contrast violations)
- it didn't have dark mode (okay this is probably not necessary, but I wanted
  it)

So I did a revamp. It's live now at
[static.alhinds.com](https://static.alhinds.com).

## Before and after

<div style={{ display: 'grid', gridTemplateColumns: '1fr 1fr', gap: '1rem' }}>
  <img
    src="https://static.alhinds.com/resume-into-a-website/mobile-before.png"
    alt="Screenshot of the old resume in mobile"
  />
  <img
    src="https://static.alhinds.com/resume-into-a-website/mobile.png"
    alt="Screenshot of the new resume in mobile"
  />
</div>

Note this still prints at A4. I didn't change the HTML structure at all. What I
did change was some of the design constraints (via CSS) for the mobile view. The
key now is that all content flows in a column/block layout on all viewports,
with some of the typography and spacing also scaling with the viewport.

Because I've been working heavily in the design system space recently I also
coined a proper theme file for the site which I'm now sharing with this website
too. This means all the typography, color and space requirements are defined in
one place and this helps to keep the two sites in relative harmony.
