            <p>I'm a software engineer and former journalist with a passion for
              UX/UI, frontend engineering and web development. I bring a unique
              set of skills and experience with nearly a decade in journalism,
              combined with long stints at some of the world's best technology
              companies. Lately my focus has been on Design Systems, but I
              thrive at the intersection of design and engineering.</p>

              <p>
                I'm most comfortable working in Typescript and JavaScript (Full
                Stack), Python, HTML, CSS and a little WebGL - basically all the
                major web technologies. I've worked largely in a Unix
                environments and have tended to focus heavily on React, Figma,
                Vue.js, Docker and node. I've dabbled with other frameworks and
                languages too and generally have little trouble picking up new
                things if the stack requires it.
